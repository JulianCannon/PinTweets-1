This website maps Tweets found using Twitter's search API, principally by geocoding the names listed in Twitter user profiles. It's results are flawed but fun.

Wishlist:
-HTML5 this up for a phone
-Add node backend
-Handle limit breach better. Actually read JSON's instead of relying on timeout.
-Get hand icon to work better when dragging pin.

Ad-hoc location fixes to be implemented:
-Get rid of "Earth" (maps to Earth, Texas)
-Make "Jersey" "New Jersey" (maps to isle of tax-evasion in English Channel)
-Map all three digit numbers as area codes
