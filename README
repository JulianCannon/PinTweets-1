This website maps Tweets found using Twitter's search API, principally by geocoding the names listed in Twitter user profiles. Its results are flawed but fun.

IMPORTANT: GOOGLE GEOCODING API TIMES OUT FOR MOST RESULTS. MUST THROTTLE API AND HANDLE UI BY REZOOMING EVERY 8 SECONDS.

Wishlist:
-HTML5 this up for a phone
-Add node backend
	-Enable sign-in so that people can see who they follow, use straming API?
	-Add learning mechanism for misplacced Tweets
-Handle limit breach better. Actually read JSON's instead of relying on timeout (MUCH LESS OF AN ISSUE WITH NO API).
-Get hand icon to work better when dragging pin.
