I intend to both improve pintweets.com and fork this into a million and one cool geographic websites. If you would like to do either, feel free to fork this and contact me.

Ad-hoc location fixes:
-Get rid of "Earth" (maps to Earth, Texas)
-Make "Jersey" "New Jersey" (maps to isle of tax-evasion in English Channel)

Other wishlist:
-Handle limit breach better. Actually read JSON's instead of relying on timeout.
-Tell Twitter to get user field into SEARCH API results so that limit is a non-issue.
